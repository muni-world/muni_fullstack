Subject: Public Records Act Request - Bond Issuance Costs
Dear <MS./MR.>:
Pursuant to my rights under the <STATE OPEN RECORDS/FOIA STATUTE>, I request an 
itemized listing of costs the district incurred when issuing general obligation bonds in 
<YEARS OF INTEREST>.
<NOTE SPECIFIC ISSUANCE DETAILS> Specifically, on <DATE>, <ISSUER, e.g. school 
district, public untility, city, etc.> issued <AMOUNT OF ISSUANACE, FACE VALUE> 
of <TYPE OF BONDS, e.g. general obligation, revenue, etc.>. According to the offering 
document, available at <PASTE URL FOR  ISSUANCE DOCUMENT> the cost of issu-
ance was <CITE COST OF ISSUANCE FIGURE IN THE ISSUANCE DOCUMENT>. I am 
requesting an itemized list of expenses totaling <CITE COST OF ISSUANCE FIGURE IN 
THE ISSUANCE  DOCUMENT>. 
I ask that you send me the listing in electronic form via return email. 
In accordance with the Public Records Act, I request that you make a determination 
within ten days as to whether this information is in the district’s possession and whether 
it’s release is possible.
If you determine that any or all or the information qualifies for an exemption from dis-
closure, I ask you to note whether, as is normally the case under the Act, the exemption 
is discretionary, and if so whether it is necessary in this case to exercise your discretion 
to withhold the information.
If you determine that some but not all of the information is exempt from disclosure and 
that you intend to withhold it, I ask that you redact it for the time being and make the 
rest available as requested.
In any event, please provide a signed notification citing the legal authorities on which 
you rely if you determine that any or all of the information is exempt and will not be 
disclosed.
If I can provide any clarification that will help expedite your attention to my request, 
please contact me at <PROVIDE CONTACT INFORMATION>. I ask that you notify me 
of any duplication costs exceeding $5 before you duplicate the records so that I may 
decide which records I want copied.
Thank you, in advance, for your time in fulfilling this request.
